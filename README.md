# Technology Used
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn

# Datasets Used
Unfortunately, I can't find the exact source of the dataset since spotify altered it. The data used, however, is titled *"spotify_dataset.csv"*.

# Test Results
After 12 runs with tuned parameters, the best genre prediction accuracy was 60.6%. The parameters used are shown below.
